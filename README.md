# cdbarcelona_coordination

Coordination &amp; planning resources for the Continuous Delivery Barcelona community

## CDBarcelona objectives

As a community, our common aim is to engage people to onboard into CD, or improve their current setup,
thanks to:

* sharing resources (news, blog posts, papers, tools-announcements)
* knowledge (hints, experiences)
* and support (just creating the community/space for discussions and networking)...

... via the communication channels we are promoting (see below). One of the most visible
initiatives is the [meetup group](meetup/)... feel free to join and contribute!
