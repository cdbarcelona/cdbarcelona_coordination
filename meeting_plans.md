# Meeting plans

## Meeting frequency...

* We can start by trying to schedule meetups once every two months
  * We start conservative, as we don't want to “burn” the community, neither suffer from poor presentations quality
  * If filling the slots becomes easy or difficult, we will revisit the schedule

## ...starting on

October 2019

## Meetups shape

* Between 1h and 1h:30 min
* 1, 2 or 3 sessions, each of <=45m (not a hard limit - exceptions allowed if justified)
* Normally in English...
  * ...but specific dates where we can consolidate talks from speakers who are not comfortable presenting
  in English (the “local”/non-English day?)

## Meetups topics

If there is enough proposals, we can try to introduce "topic days". Examples:

* Local/Non-English day
* Culture day: let's speak about non-tech topics around CD
* Papers day: lets present research papers touching CI/CD
* Conference day: let's summarize/play/reproduce/analyse talks from a conference we find relevant
* Tech day: lets just speak about tech
* Vendor day: lets allow one (or multiple) vendors to present their proposal/services/tools to implement CI/CD
* Tech-battle day: let's benchmark/compare and discuss tooling/platform
* Workshop day: Lets play with the tool X together
* Demo day
* Testing automation day

Or just accommodate the speaking proposals we may have, if there are not many options / we cannot group them by topic.

## Looking for speakers

* In order to spin the wheel, we can try to use our network to find speaker
* With the meetup (re)bootstrap announcement, we can also open a formal CfP (how do we accept requests? which topics?)
* We need to monitor conferences in Barcelona to invite speakers or plan activities around them (which ones? to elaborate)

## Logistics

* We can get support from companies, but they must rotate (we don't want to create associations between this meetup and a specific company)
* Next (and first after this re-bootstrap) can be coordinated collaboratively. For the next ones, we can rotate a "meetup lead"
role between coordinators
