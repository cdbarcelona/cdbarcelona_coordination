## Why a meetup?

> *How the meetup can bring value to the Barcelona community? Why this may work?*

* Vendor agnostic: we can touch specific tools, solutions or implementations, but a clear
differentiator to the Hashicorp, k8s or AWS meetups is we are not limited to a set of solutions
* Quite specific area, so we can bring very specific knowledge compared to meetups touching wider
areas (devops, cloud, Agile)
* There is interest. It was not a very active meetup, but there are more than 300 subscribers.
* We have a good network to bring speakers

## Meeting frequency

* We are trying to schedule meetups once every two months
  * We start conservative, as we don't want to “burn” the community, neither suffer from poor presentations quality
  * If filling the slots becomes easy or difficult, we will revisit the schedule
* ...starting on **October 2019**

## Meetups shape

* Between 1h and 1h:30 min
* 1, 2 or 3 sessions, each of <=45m (not a hard limit - exceptions allowed if justified)
* Normally in English...
  * ...but specific dates where we can consolidate talks from speakers who are not comfortable presenting
  in English (the “local”/non-English day?)

## Meetups topics

If there is enough proposals, we can try to introduce "topic days". Examples:

* Local/Non-English day
* Culture day: let's speak about non-tech topics around CD
* Papers day: lets present research papers touching CI/CD
* Conference day: let's summarize/play/reproduce/analyse talks from a conference we find relevant
* Tech day: lets just speak about tech
* Vendor/Demo day: lets allow one (or multiple) vendors to present their proposal/services/tools to implement CI/CD
* Tech-battle day: let's benchmark/compare and discuss tooling/platform
* Workshop/hands-on day: Lets play with the tool X together
* Testing-automation day

Or just accommodate the speaking proposals we may have, if there are not many options / we cannot group them by topic.

## Looking for speakers

* Public CfP: please, submit a PR against [talk_proposals.md](talk_proposals.md)
* The group coordination will use its network to find speakers when needed, and also have a
pool of "backup talks" they can lead
* We need to monitor conferences in Barcelona to invite speakers or plan activities around them (TODO):
  * which ones? to elaborate

## Logistics

* We can get support from companies, but they must rotate (we don't want to create associations between this meetup and a specific company)
* A "meetup lead" role will be rotated between coordinators
