# Group objectives

Engage people to onboard into CD, or improve their current setup, thanks to:

* sharing resources
* knowledge (hints, experiences)
* and support (just creating the community/space for discussions and networking)

## Meetup initiative

How the meetup can bring value to the Barcelona community? Why this may work?

* Vendor agnostic: we can touch specific tools, solutions or implementations, but a clear
differentiator to the Hashicorp, k8s or AWS meetups is we are not limited to a set of solutions
* Quite specific area, so we can bring very specific knowledge compared to meetups touching wider areas (devops, cloud)
* There is interest. It was not a very active meetup, but there are more than 300 subscribers.
* We have a good network to bring speakers
